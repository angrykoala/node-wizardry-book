# Node Wizardry

_Andrés Ortiz - @angrykoala_

This book covers the basics of JavaScript development using Node.js, applying modern development tools and techniques.

I recommend to have some previous experience in JavaScript programming, or at least in a similar programming language such as Java or Python. Most of the JavaScript basics are explained through this book, but is better to learn from a full course if you don't know anything about it.

## How to read

This book divided in 3 main sections, ordered according to how I like to learn a new language/technology myself. It's worth noting that I've never been able to read more than a third of any programming book, so you can expect the first third of this book to be similar to other programming book.

The 3 main sections are:

* **Basic Topics**: Introduces the basics of Node and JavaScript. How to install and work with Node.js and a bit of theory (a.k.a. the book-est part of this book).

* **Projects**: This part contains different small projects, each of will show different features of node, and will produce a fully functional application at the end, using only the minimum required tools for that. Except the first project, which serves as a basic introduction, you can do all the other projects in any order you want (or even skip 'em). This section is made that way because, for me, the best way to learn programming is to program, but an single big project leads to a lot of boring, repetitive code that doesn't teach anything, small projects lets you focus on the important bits.

* **Advanced Topics**: This part describes several important features and aspects of Node.js development, like the projects, each chapter describes one concrete topic (like testing or versioning), and you can study them in any desired order, after or while working with the projects described in the second part or along with your own projects.

Basically, the first part (and the first project) serves as an introduction/tutorial of Node.js development, from there this book turns into a series of independent _guides_ with the intention of getting you to work with Node as soon as possible and with the thing you actually need.
