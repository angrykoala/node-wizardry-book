# Node Wizardry

_Andrés Ortiz - @angrykoala_

This book covers the main concepts of JavaScript development using Node.js, applying modern development tools and techniques.

I recommend to have some previous experience in JavaScript programming, or at least in a similar programming language such as Java or Python. Most of the JavaScript basics are explained through this book, but it is better to learn from a full JS course if you don't know anything about it.

## How to read

This book divided in 3 main sections, ordered according to how I like to learn a new language/technology myself. It's worth noting that I've never been able to read more than a third of any programming book, so you can expect only the first third of this book to be similar to other programming book.

The 3 main sections are:

* **Basic Topics**: Introduces the basics of Node.js and JavaScript ES6. How to install and work with them and a bit of theory.

* **Projects**: This part contains different small projects showing different features of Node, and will result in a wokring application at the end, using only the minimum required tools for that. Except the first project, which serves as a basic introduction, you can do all the other projects in any order you want \(or even skip them\).

* **Advanced Topics**: This part describes several important features and aspects of Node.js development, like the projects, each chapter describes one specific topic \(like testing or versioning\), and you can study them in any desired order, after or while working with the projects described in the second part or along with your own projects.

Basically, the first part \(and the first project\) serves as an introduction/tutorial of Node.js development, from there this book turns into a series of independent _guides_ with the intention of getting you to work with Node as soon as possible with whatever you actually need.
