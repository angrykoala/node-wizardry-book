# Node Wizardry

This book aims to cover the basics of JavaScript development using Node.js with modern development tools.

## How to read

This book is divided in 3 parts:

* **Basic Topics**: Introduces the basics of Node and JavaScript. How to install and work with Node.js
* **Projects**: This part contains different small projects, each of those is intended to teach different parts of node libraries and features, and are intended to produce a fully functional application at the end of each project, using only the required tools for that. With the exception of the first project, which serves as a basic introduction, all the other projects can be done at any desired order \(or skipped, if not interested\).
* **Advance Topics**: This part describes several important features and aspects of node.js development, as with the projects, each chapter describes one concrete topic \(such as testing or versioning\) and can be studied in any desired order, after or while working with the projects described in the second part or with your own projects.

So, basically, the first part \(and the first projects\) serves as an introduction/tutorial of node.js development, from there this book turns into a series of _guides_ with the intention of getting you to work in node as soon as possible.
