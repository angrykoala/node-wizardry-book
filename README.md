# Node Wizardry

_Andrés Ortiz - @angrykoala_

This book aims to cover the basics of JavaScript development using Node.js applying modern development tools and techniques.

I recommend to have some previous experience in JavaScript programming, or at least in a similar programming language such as Java or Python. Most of the needed JavaScript basics will be explained, but it is better to know from a full course if you don't know anything about it.

## How to read

This book divided in 3 main sections, and it is ordered according to how I like to learn a new language/technology myself. It's worth noting that I've never been able to read more than a third of any programming book, so you can expect the first third of this book to be similar to other programming book. Afterwards, it may or not be like other books, I couldn't say.

The 3 sections then, are:

* **Basic Topics**: Introduces the basics of Node and JavaScript. How to install and work with Node.js and a bit of theory \(a.k.a. the book-ish part of this book\)
* **Projects**: This part contains different small projects, each of those is intended to teach different features of node, and are intended to produce a fully functional application at the end of each project, using only the required tools for that. With the exception of the first project, which serves as a basic introduction, all the other projects can be done at any desired order \(or skipped, if not interested\). This section is made that way as, for me, the best way to learn programming is to program, but an unique big project usually leads to a lot of boring, repetitive code that doesn't really teach anything, small projects lets you focus on the important parts.
* **Advanced Topics**: This part describes several important features and aspects of Node.js development, as with the projects, each chapter describes one concrete topic \(such as testing or versioning\) and can be studied in any desired order, after or while working with the projects described in the second part or along with your own projects.

So, basically, the first part \(and the first project\) serves as an introduction/tutorial of node.js development, from there this book turns into a series of _guides_ with the intention of getting you to work in Node as soon as possible.
