# JavaScript "Features"

> It's not a bug, it's a feature

* Arrays accept non-integer indexes:
  * `myArr[3.2]="Hello";`

* Map structures don't accept _square brackets_... but it doesn't fail

* Arrays can set any index \(e.g. myArr\[1000\]\) which will fill the array with undefined up to that point.
