# You first app

Finally, the time has come, lets create something. For this first approach to Node.js development, we will cover some of the basics of writing a \_web server \_with node. As you may know, even if Node.js is as versatile \(or more\) than any other language, it is usually applied to back-end web development.

The best \(and simplest\) way to start a project with node JS is opening a terminal, going to the folder where you are going to put your code and write:

```bash
npm init
```

This command will start an interactive interface to create the _package.json_ file. It will also try to fill some items with reasonable values \(e.g. using the current folder as project name\). All the values can be changes later.

After executing `npm init` , you'll see the _package.json_ file. As mentioned before, this file contains all the metadata, dependencies and entry point of your project. If you open it, you'll see something like this:

```json
{


}
```
