# Chat App

## Description
For this project we will be building one of the classics of Node.js, a IRC-style chat application. We will rely on [Socket.io](https://socket.io) library, which allows us to easily use _websockets_. Thanks to this, out chat will be up and running in no time.

### About websockets
Websockets is a relatively new technology standard in most moder browsers, and with implementation in most languages and platforms (e.g. Android). When creating a websocket we will have a permanent bi-directional connection between a client and our server, this way, with a very little overhead, we can send data both ways without creating and destroying a connection with each message.
